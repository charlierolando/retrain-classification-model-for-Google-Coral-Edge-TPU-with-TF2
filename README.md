## [How to use:](#how-to-use)

- Put images data that you want to train into the 'train_data' directory with configuration, one folder for one classification data (create names of folders according to classification). click [this](https://github.com/charlierolando/retrain-classification-model-for-Google-Coral-Edge-TPU-with-TF2/blob/main/source/train_data/) to see the example.

- For your non-Colab code, be sure you have tensorflow==1.15

- If there are any errors with numpy, be sure you have numpy==1.19

- Run [this](https://github.com/charlierolando/retrain-classification-model-for-Google-Coral-Edge-TPU-with-TF2/blob/main/source/train.ipynb)

- After compile the tflite file, run [this code](https://github.com/charlierolando/retrain-classification-model-for-Google-Coral-Edge-TPU-with-TF2/blob/main/source/classify_image_test.py) to test the classification. Read [this notes](https://github.com/charlierolando/retrain-classification-model-for-Google-Coral-Edge-TPU-with-TF2/blob/main/source/note_for_classify_image_test.py.txt).

```python
# Example
python3 classify_image_test.py --model tflite_file_edgetpu.tflite --labels labels.txt --input test_data/Clip.jpg
```
